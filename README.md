# t2-soup
A collection of packages & dotfiles for my GNU/Linux Setup running on a MacBook Pro with T2 Security Chip.
Mostly for keeping track of configuration changes.

### WIP
This repo is work-in-progress, I haven't got to including all configs files yet. That being said, I will add more custom configurations & documentation over time as I prove what works in every-day use.
In addition, I just transitioned from the Arch based distro EndeavourOS that I have been using for a good year to a self-configured, Vanilla Arch Setup. I might put this in a seperate repo though.

Do not blindly apply these files in your setup! (especially as there's not everything here yet :D)

# Tailored for T2 Custom Linux Kernel
Running GNU/Linux on a MacBook comes with it's own caveats, this repository is an attempt on sharing what works with my setup. 
S/O to t2linux.org - which is where I've got my custom ISO from to install EndeavorOS, an Arch based distro, on my MacBook Pro 15" 2018 (A1990).

# WIP: Hyprland!

Currently configuring hyprland as seperate WM for more customized experience, while keeping the GNOME environment functional for other, less tech-savvy users of my laptop. 
Again, WIP! Basic Config files are already included, rest be published soon.
Also - I don't know whether to keep GNOME.
